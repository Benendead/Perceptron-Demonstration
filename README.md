# Perceptron-Demonstration
## Summary: A simple perceptron class I've coded using the numpy and matplotlib libraries.

### Goals
This project's goals included testing my Python class-building abilities, learning some useful Python libraries, and 
developing an intuition for this fundamental ML algorithm.

### Process
I coded the perceptron using the model presented in *Learning From Data* by Yaser Abu-Mostafa, Malik Magdon-Ismail, and 
Hsuan-Tien Lin. I decided to illustrate the classification problem using matplotlib, and also created a Point class to store 
the training/test examples intuitively. There are two training methods: one that trains on a given number of points, and 
another which trains on all available points in the training dataset. There's also a method which lowers the perceptron's 
learning rate before again training the perceptron on all points. The notebook ends with some testing methods which show 
the incorrectly classified points as well as compare the perceptron's decision boundary with the ground-truth line.

### Project's Result
A Jupyter Notebook containing all classes and methods described above.
